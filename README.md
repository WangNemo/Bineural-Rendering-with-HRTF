# Bineural Rendering with HRTF
This was the final project for the course Sound Analysis, Synthesis and Processing. 
Developed by me and @rtirene

### Briefly
The main steps are:
- acquire the source signal with an Eigenmike
- field decomposition with Sperical Harmonic Decomposition
- field reconstruction with Plane Wave Decomposition
- convolution with HRTF

Note: the databases we have used are not included (CIPIC, Symare and Eigenmike signals)
